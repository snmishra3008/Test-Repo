Adhoc command

ansible host-pattern - m module [ -a 'module arguments']

#host pattern -- list of hosts

to see the list of the moduels
ansible-doc -m
ansible-doc -l -t connection #list of all connection types present in ansible.

set command displays local and remote variables 
use shell module in case of finding  dependig upon variable modules in that env.
check raw module.

=============
Always write inventory in correct alphabatic order

#ansible-doc -s yum
Above statement is used to tell which keywords can be used in that modules.

ansible-doc modulename
#check at last before example if the module is stable and who supports it.

ansible-inventory --graph (shows inventory in tree structure)
groupname will come in @

==========facts==
facts name to ne degined as name extension .fact

=================
Reducing tab spaces
Make ~/.vimrc and add this:

set tabstop=4
Here are some other helpful ones:

syntax on " Syntax highlighting
set showmatch " Shows matching brackets
set ruler " Always shows location in file (line#)
set smarttab " Autotabs for certain code
set shiftwidth=4

=============Create roles directory====
mkdir roles
cd roles
ansible-galaxy init test-roles

=========troubleshooting===
by default there is no log file.
need to enable login

1) log_path=./log/pathname

step is interactive mode execution.

task , add_host -- adding host when it is not part of inventory (learn).
name hostname,
ipaddress


delegate_to servera -- runnig a task in perticular host.
Eg: 
- uri
    url: http://servera
  delegate_to: servera
